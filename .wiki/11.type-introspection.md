## Introspecting Kotlin Types for OpenAPI Schemas

This document provides a high-level explanation of how type inspection works,
including how type traversal is performed.

### Key Features:

* Recursive Inspection: Capable of handling complex types, including nested and self-referencing objects.
* Comprehensive Type Support: Processes primitive types, enums, collections, maps, arrays, and generic types.
* Annotation Support: Recognizes annotations from kotlinx serialization. Supports a subset of Jackson annotations.
* Caching Mechanism: Caches resolved schemas to improve performance and avoid redundant processing.
* Conflict Detection: Identifies conflicts where different types may have the same name.

### Core Components

Before diving into the flow, it's essential to understand the primary components involved in the type inspection process:

1. `TypeInspector`: The entry point that initiates the inspection process for a given type.
2. `TypeResolver`: The core orchestrator delegating to specific resolvers based on the type characteristics.
3. `Resolvers`: Specialized components that handle different kinds of types:
    1. `CustomTypeResolver`: Handles user-defined custom types.
    2. `ArrayResolver`: Handles array types.
    3. `CollectionResolver`: Handles collection types like `List` and `Set`, including typed `Array<T>`s.
    4. `MapResolver`: Handles `map` types.
    5. `EnumResolver`: Handles enumeration types.
    6. `GenericsResolver`: Handles `generics` types with type parameters.
    7. `ObjectResolver`: Handles complex object types, such as classes and data classes.
    8. `PropertyResolver`: Handles the properties of complex types, extracting metadata and resolving property types.

### High-Level Flow

The inspection process involves initiating the inspection of a given Kotlin type
and recursively traversing its structure to build the corresponding schema.
The flow includes decision-making to determine the appropriate resolver for each type
and may involve recursion to handle nested types.

### Main Inspection Entry Flow

```text
Start
 |
 v
TypeInspector initiates inspection of Kotlin type
 |
 v
TypeResolver checks the type characteristics and delegates to appropriate resolvers
```

* `TypeResolver`: Serves as the entry point, starting the inspection for a given type.
* `TypeResolver`: Analyzes the type and decides which resolver should handle it based on its characteristics.

---

### TypeResolver Decision Tree

The `TypeResolver` uses a decision tree to determine how to process a given type.
This tree guides the traversal and ensures that each type is handled by the appropriate resolver.

* Delegation: At each decision point, the `TypeResolver` either delegates to a specific resolver
  or constructs a default schema if the type cannot be processed.

### Detailed Flow

#### Starting Inspection with TypeInspector

- Initiation: The `TypeInspector` starts the inspection process for the given Kotlin type.
- Conflict Analysis: After the traversal, it analyzes for any conflicts, such as schemas with the same name but different types.
- Result: The `TypeInspector` returns the resolved `TypeSchema`.

#### Traversal with TypeResolver

- Classifier Determination: The `TypeResolver` examines the type to determine its nature (e.g., array, collection, map).
- Decision-Making: Based on the decision tree, it determines which resolver is appropriate for the type.
- Delegation: It delegates the processing to the chosen resolver.
- Recursion: If necessary, the `TypeResolver` uses recursion to handle nested types.

#### Resolvers Interaction and Processing

- **CustomTypeResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles user-defined custom types.
    - Process:
        - Checks if the type is registered as a custom type.
        - If registered and not already cached:
            - Builds the schema for the custom type.
            - Adds the schema to the cache.
        - Returns the schema or a reference to it.

- **ArrayResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles array types, differentiating between primitive arrays and typed arrays.
    - Process:
        - Determines if the array is a primitive array (e.g., `IntArray`).
            - If yes, processes it immediately and constructs the schema.
        - If not a primitive array, checks if it's a typed array (e.g., `Array<String>`).
            - If yes, delegates processing to the `CollectionResolver`.
        - If neither, constructs an unknown object type schema.

- **CollectionResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles collection types like `List` and `Set`.
    - Process:
        - Resolves the element type of the collection.
        - Traverses the element type using the `TypeResolver`, which may involve recursion.
        - Constructs the collection schema using the element schema.

- **MapResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles Map types.
    - Process:
        - Validates that the map's key type is `String` (as required by OpenAPI).
        - Resolves the value type of the map.
        - Traverses the value type using the `TypeResolver`.
        - Constructs the map schema with `additionalProperties` representing the value schema.

- **EnumResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles enumeration types.
    - Process:
        - Extracts the list of possible `enum` values.
        - Constructs the `enum` schema.
        - Adds the schema to the cache if not already present.
        - Returns the schema or a reference to it.

- **GenericsResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles generic types with type parameters.
    - Process:
        - Generates a unique name for the generic type (e.g., `PageOfEmployee`).
        - If not already cached:
            - Creates a local type parameter map, mapping generic type parameters to actual types.
            - Merges the local map with any inherited type parameter map.
            - Traverses each property of the generic type:
                - Uses the `TypeResolver` to traverse property types, substituting type parameters as necessary.
            - Constructs the schema for the generic type.
            - Adds the schema to the cache.
        - Returns the schema or a reference to it.

- **ObjectResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles complex object types, such as classes and data classes.
    - Process:
        - Checks if the type is a primitive type.
            - If yes, maps it directly to its schema representation.
        - If not, handles it as a complex type:
            - Uses a semaphore to prevent infinite recursion in case of self-referencing types.
            - Adds a placeholder schema to the cache before processing properties.
            - Retrieves the properties of the object using the PropertyResolver.
            - Traverses each property recursively using the `TypeResolver`.
            - Updates the placeholder schema with the resolved properties.
            - Removes the type from the semaphore after processing.
        - Returns the schema or a reference to it.

- **PropertyResolver**
    - Purpose: Handles the properties of complex types, extracting metadata and resolving property types.
    - Process:
        - Retrieves the properties of the class, preserving their declaration order.
            - Includes properties from primary constructors and class bodies.
            - Excludes non-public properties.
        - For each property:
            - Extracts metadata such as name, nullability, and annotations.
            - Resolves the property's type, substituting generics as necessary.
            - Traverses the property's type using the `TypeResolver`.
            - Applies metadata to the property's schema.
            - Collects property schemas to be included in the parent object's schema.

#### Handling Generics and Type Parameters

- **Type Parameter Map:**
    - Purpose: Keeps track of substitutions for generic type parameters during traversal.
    - Behavior:
        - Isolation: Each traversal context maintains its own map to prevent interference between different generic contexts.
        - Propagation: Passed down during recursive traversal to ensure correct substitutions at each level.
    - Usage:
        - When traversing a generic type, a local map is created mapping type parameters to concrete types.
        - The local map is merged with any inherited type parameter map.
        - Used during traversal to substitute generic parameters with actual types.
    - Flow:
        - When inspecting `Container<T>`, and `T` is mapped to `SomeType`,
          the map `{ T -> SomeType }` is used to substitute `T` with `SomeType`.

- **Example:** inspecting `Page<Employee>`
    - Scenario:
        - `Page<T>` is a generic class with a type parameter `T`.
        - We are inspecting `Page<Employee>`, where `T` is `Employee`.
    - Process:
        - The `TypeResolver` recognizes `Page` as a generic type with type parameter `T`.
        - Creates a type parameter map `{ T -> Employee }`.
        - Traverses properties of `Page<T>`:
            - For the property content: `T`, substitutes `T` with `Employee`.
            - Traverses `Employee` recursively.
    - Constructs the schema for `PageOfEmployee`, referencing the `Employee` schema.

#### Caching and Circular References

- **Caching:**
    - Purpose: Avoids redundant processing by storing resolved schemas.
    - Mechanism:
        - Before processing a type, checks if it's already in the cache.
        - If cached, uses the existing schema reference.
        - Adds new schemas to the cache after processing.
    - Benefit: Enhances performance and efficiency, especially with recursive or shared types.

- ** Circular Reference Handling:**
    - Purpose: Prevents infinite recursion when types reference themselves directly or indirectly.
    - Mechanism:
        - Uses a semaphore to track types currently being processed.
        - Adds a placeholder schema to the cache before traversing properties.
        - Updates the placeholder schema after traversal is complete.
        - Removes the type from the semaphore after processing.
    - Behavior:
        - When a class has a property of its own type, or any of its nested properties is of the same type,
          the semaphore detects this self-reference, prevents infinite recursion, and returns a self-reference
          scheme while the type is still being processed, ensuring proper handling of deeply nested structures.
