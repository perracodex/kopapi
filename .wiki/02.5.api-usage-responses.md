## Defining Responses

Define the possible responses from the endpoint:

```kotlin
api {
    // Response with a body.
    response<MyResponseType>(HttpStatusCode.OK) {
        description = "Successfully retrieved the item."
        contentType = ContentType.Application.Json
    }
    // Response without a body.
    response(HttpStatusCode.NotFound) {
        description = "The item was not found."
    }
}
```

### Adding Headers and Links to Responses

Add headers and links to responses:

```kotlin
api {
    response<MyResponseType>(HttpStatusCode.OK) {
        description = "Successfully retrieved the item."
        header("X-Rate-Limit") {
            description = "The number of allowed requests in the current period."
            required = true
        }
        link("getNextItem") {
            description = "Link to the next item."
        }
    }
}
```

- **Headers properties:**
    - `name`: The name of the header.
    - `description`: A human-readable description of the header.
    - `required`: Indicates whether the header is mandatory.
    - `deprecated`: Indicates whether the header is deprecated and should be avoided.


- **Link properties:**
    - `operationId`: The name of an existing, resolvable OAS operation.
    - `description`: A human-readable description of the link.
