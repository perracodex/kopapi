## Summary and Description

Provide a brief summary and detailed description of the endpoint:

```kotlin
api {
    summary = "Retrieve a list of items."
    description = "Fetches all items available in the inventory."
    description = "Supports pagination and filtering."
}
```

- Multiple `description` calls can be used to provide additional information.
  These will be appended with a newline character between each description.
- The `summary` can also be declared multiple times, but will be appended with a space character between each summary.
