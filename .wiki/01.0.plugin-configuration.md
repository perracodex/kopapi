## Plugin Configuration

### Configuration Properties

The `KopapiConfig` provides several properties to define the URLs for your OpenAPI schemas, Swagger UI, and debugging endpoints.

| Property           | Description                                                                           | Default        |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| enabled            | The plugin enabled state.<br/>Useful to disable the plugin for specific environments. | True           |
| openapiYamlUrl     | The URL to provide the OpenAPI schema in `YAML` format.                               | /openapi/yaml  |
| openapiJsonUrl     | The URL to provide the OpenAPI schema in `JSON` format.                               | /openapi/json  |
| swaggerUrl         | The URL to provide the `Swagger UI`.                                                  | /swagger       |
| swaggerSyntaxTheme | The syntax highlighting theme to use for the Swagger UI.                              | AGATE          |
| redocUrl           | The URL to provide the OpenAPI `Redoc` documentation.                                 | /redoc         |
| debugUrl           | The URL to provide the API metadata for debugging purposes.                           | /openapi/debug |
| info               | Metadata about your API (title, description, version, contact, license, etc.).        | N/A            |
| servers            | List of servers to include in the OpenAPI schema, with optional URL variables.        | N/A            |
| security           | List of global security schemes, overriding per endpoint schemes.                     | N/A            |

### Defining the Plugin URL Endpoints

The plugin provides default URLs for the OpenAPI schema in `JSON` and `YAML` formats,
the `Swagger UI`, and the debugging endpoint.

```kotlin
install(Kopapi) {
    enabled = true
    openapiJsonUrl = "api/openapi.json"
    openapiYamlUrl = "api/openapi.yaml"
    swaggerUrl = "api/swagger"
    debugUrl = "api/debug"
}
```

The `debugUrl` endpoint provides access to vital diagnostic information that assists in troubleshooting the plugin behavior.
If the schema is not generated as expected, you can use this endpoint to inspect and identify potential issues.

---

### Defining the API Info Section

The `Info` section can be used to provide metadata about your API.

```kotlin
install(Kopapi) {
    info {
        title = "API Title"
        description = "Api Description"
        version = "1.0.0"
        termsOfService = "https://example.com/terms"

        contact {
            name = "John Doe"
            url = "https://example.com/support"
            email = "support@example.com"
        }

        license {
            name = "MIT"
            url = "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
        }
    }
}
```

Note that the description can be declared multiple times to support multi-line descriptions, without the need for manual line breaks.
Each of the descriptions will be concatenated into a single description divided by a new line.

```text
{
    ...
    description = "Api Description."
    description = "This is a multi-line description."
    description = "Each description will be concatenated into one."
    ...
}
```        

Will result in the following description:

```text
Api Description.
This is a multi-line description.
Each description will be concatenated into a single description.
```

### Example

```kotlin
install(Kopapi) {
    enabled = true
    openapiJsonUrl = "api/openapi.json"
    openapiYamlUrl = "api/openapi.yaml"
    swaggerUrl = "api/swagger"
    debugUrl = "api/debug"

    // API Info section.
    info {
        title = "API Title"
        description = "Api Description"
        description = "This is a multi-line description."
        version = "1.0.0"
        termsOfService = "https://example.com/terms"

        contact {
            name = "John Doe"
            url = "https://example.com/support"
            email = "support@example.com"
        }

        license {
            name = "MIT"
            url = "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
        }
    }
}
```
