## Adding Security Schemes to Endpoints

Besides global security schemes in the plugin main configuration, security schemes can be defined
in each individual endpoint, overriding the global configuration.

- Scheme names must be unique across the global and endpoint security schemes.
- When a security scheme is defined in an endpoint, all the global security schemes are ignored.
- Security schemes can be disabled for an endpoint.

---

- For detailed information on the security schemes supported at the endpoint level,
  see the plugin [Security](01.2.security.md) section, as the syntax is the same.

---

### Disable Security

Use the `noSecurity` method to disable security for an endpoint, so globally defined security schemes do not apply to it.

```kotlin
noSecurity()
```

- If defining the `noSecurity` method in combination with other security schemes within the same endpoint,
  all other security schemes in that endpoint are ignored.
